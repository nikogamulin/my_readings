【Original Text】The gap between
wishful thinking and reality is vast, but in a democratic
society no contest of ideas and proposals can proceed in
rational ways without all sides sharing at least a modicum
of relevant information about the real world, rather than
trotting out their biases and advancing claims disconnected
from physical possibilities

【Original Text】By 1800 a passing probe will record that, across the
planet, plant fuels still supply more than 98 percent of all
heat and light used by the dominant bipeds, and that
human and animal muscles still provide more than 90
percent of all mechanical energy needed in farming,
construction, and manufacturing

【Original Text】But by 2020 more than half of the world’s
electricity will still be generated by the combustion of fossil
fuels, mainly coal and natural gas

【Original Text】Simply put, energy is the only
truly universal currency, and nothing (from galactic
rotations to ephemeral insect lives) can take place without
its transformations.24

【Original Text】This led to what is still the most common
definition of energy: “the capacity for doing work

【Original Text】large nuclear reactors are
the most reliable producers of electricity: some of them
now generate it 90–95 percent of the time, compared to
about 45 percent for the best offshore wind turbines and 25
percent for photovoltaic cells in even the sunniest of
climates—while Germany’s solar panels produce electricity
only about 12 percent of the time.33

【Original Text】In 1900, less than 2 percent of
the world’s fossil fuel production was used to generate
electricity; by 1950 that share was still less than 10
percent; it now stands at about 25 percent

【Original Text】Notice the key qualifying adjective: the target is not total
decarbonization but “net zero” or carbon neutrality

Time：2022-07-16 17:57
【Original Text】Turbofan engines powering jetliners burn fuel whose
energy density is 46 megajoules per kilogram (that’s nearly
12,000 watt-hours per kilogram), converting chemical to
thermal and kinetic energy—while today’s best Li-ion
batteries supply less than 300 Wh/kg, more than a 40-fold
difference.7

【Original Text】Securing a sufficient quantity and nutritional variety of
food is the existential imperative for every species

【Original Text】Foraging in arid environments could require an
area of more than 100 square kilometers to support a
single family

【Original Text】In ancient Egypt, the density rate rose from about
1.3 people per hectare of cultivated land during the
predynastic period (pre–3150 BCE) to about 2.5 people per
hectare 3,500 years later, when the country was a province
of the Roman Empire

2. Understanding Food Production: Eating Fossil Fuels
Time：2022-08-23 07:50
【Original Text】As a result, no recent
transformation—such as increased personal mobility or a
greater range of private possessions—has been so
existentially fundamental as our ability to produce, year
after year, a surfeit of food
【Annotations】

Time：2022-07-21 23:06
【Original Text】This impressive achievement is even more noteworthy if
expressed in a way that accounts for the intervening largescale increase of the global population, from about 2.5
billion people in 1950 to 7.7 billion in 2019. The steep
reduction in global undernutrition means that in 1950 the
world was able to supply adequate food to about 890
million people, but by 2019 that had risen to just over 7
billion: a nearly eight-fold increase in absolute terms

Time：2022-08-23 07:55
【Original Text】but the modern world’s most important—
and fundamentally existential—dependence on fossil fuels
is their direct and indirect use in the production of our
food.

Time：2022-08-23 08:09
【Original Text】Many people nowadays admiringly quote the
performance gains of modern computing (“so much data”)
or telecommunication (“so much cheaper”)—but what
about harvests? In two centuries, the human labor to
produce a kilogram of American wheat was reduced from
10 minutes to less than two seconds. This is how our
modern world really works.

【Original Text】Modern farming requires
fungicides and insecticides to minimize crop losses, and
herbicides to prevent weeds from competing for the
available plant nutrients and water
【Annotations】

Time：2022-07-22 07:25
【Original Text】But at what cost of human toil! This great nitrogen
barrier to higher crop yields was nudged only during the
19th century with the mining and export of Chilean
nitrates, the first inorganic nitrogenous fertilizer
【Annotations】

-------------------

Time：2022-07-22 07:26
【Original Text】And the great productivity shift
known as the Green Revolution could not have taken place
without this combination of better crops and higher
nitrogen applications

【Original Text】Eventually, our food production will change, but for now,
and for the foreseeable future, we cannot feed the world
without relying on fossil fuels
【Annotations】

Time：2022-07-24 17:20
【Original Text】Detailed studies have quantified these inputs and
multiplied them by their typical energy costs: for example,
the synthesis, formulation, and packaging of 1 kilogram of
nitrogenous fertilizer requires an equivalent of nearly 1.5
liters of diesel fuel.

【Original Text】sea bass in cages
(Greece and Turkey are its leading producers) are
commonly equivalent to as much as 2–2.5 liters of diesel
fuel per kilogram (a volume about the same as three bottles
of wine)—that is, of the same order of magnitude as the
energy costs of capturing similarly sized wild species

【Original Text】Perhaps the most stunning outcome of this rise is that in
just two years—2018 and 2019—China produced nearly as
much cement (about 4.4 billion tons) as did the United
States during the entire 20th century (4.56 billion tons).
